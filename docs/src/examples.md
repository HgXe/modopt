# Examples

Here, we provide several examples demonstrating different use cases of modOpt.
These examples serve as a collection of run scripts for user reference and benchmarking optimizers.
Unlike tutorials, most examples are generated from Python (.py) files
and may include some documentation in the form of comments.
Some examples may be written in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb)
when console outputs and plots generated from running the scripts are important
and need to be included in the documentation.
