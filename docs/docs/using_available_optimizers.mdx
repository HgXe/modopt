# Using available optimizers

## Standard optimization algorithms implemented

Currently, modOpt has a fully transparent library of optimization algorithms 
implemented for unconstrained problems.
The following are the algorithms implemented:

### 1. Steepest-Descent
The implementation can be found 
**[here](https://github.com/LSDOlab/modopt/blob/main/modopt/core/optimization_algorithms/steepest_descent.py)**.

### 2. Newton
The implementation can be found 
**[here](https://github.com/LSDOlab/modopt/blob/main/modopt/core/optimization_algorithms/newton.py)**.


### 3. Quasi-Newton
The implementation can be found 
**[here](https://github.com/LSDOlab/modopt/blob/main/modopt/core/optimization_algorithms/quasi_newton.py)**.

## Usage instructions
In order to use these algorithms with any of the unconstrained problems written using
the **Problem()** class, you should first import your problem from the coresponding file
and also import the optimizer of your choice from the library.
After that, set tolerances and other parameters for the chosen optimizer.
Solve the problem and then print results.

An example is shown below for the Newton optimizer.

```py

from my_problem import MyProblem

from modopt.optimization_algorithms import SteepestDescent # can be Newton, or QuasiNewton

tol = 1E-8
max_itr = 500

prob = MyProblem()

optimizer = SteepestDescent(
    prob,
    opt_tol=tol,
    max_itr=max_itr,
    )

optimizer.check_first_derivatives(prob.x.get_data())
optimizer.solve()
optimizer.print_results(summary_table=True)
```


## External Libraries

### 1 . Scipy library

While using scipy library you can follow the same process as in the previous section
except when importing the optimizer.

You need to import the optimizer as shown in the following code 
(here we use the SLSQP optimizer):

```py
from modopt.scipy_library import SLSQP
```


### 2. SNOPT library

All libraries containing only a single optimizer is located in the 
`external_libraries` module.
While using any external library you can follow the 
same process as in the first section except when importing the optimizer.

You need to import the optimizer as shown the following code:

```py
from modopt.external_libraries import SNOPT
```
